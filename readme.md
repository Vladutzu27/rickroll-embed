# How to use the Rick Roll embed in your own stagescript projects:
* paste [this](https://github.com/Vladutzu27/rickroll-embed/blob/main/rickroll.js) code into your project
* Go to the place where you want to rickroll someone
* type this code:
```js
RickRoll(60, 0, 0, true);
```
you can modify the paramaters for your liking, but in this case it sets its size to 60, its position to x = 0 and y = 0 and because i typed true, it also plays back the Never Give you Up song
